	<h4>Version 1.5</h4> <br />

	<p>The store works just like any other digital store, with a mixture of free and paid-for resources, each with clear licensing and cost. You can search and explore, and recognise good content through ratings and reviews.
		We are now open for submissions for free resources! Thank-you to everyone in the community that got involved!</p>
	<p>If you have a resource you want to share with the rest of the community, you can upload it to the store platform, or simply provide a listing to it if it's an online service or resource, through the Curation app.</p>
	<p>In this release we've improved the try-it and resource preview functionality:</p>
	<ul class="li--releasenotes"><li><strong>Try It</strong> - You can now access try it from the preview section on a resource page and we check to make sure the URL works now, before sending you there. </li>
		<li><strong>Previews</strong> - We've made it possible to embed external content in the preview section so we can expand on the type of previews you can use to describe your resource.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Version 1.4</h4>
		<p>In version 1.4, we improved the usability around registration and login and added social sharing to the resource pages:</p>
		<ul class="li--releasenotes"><li><strong>Institutional Login</strong> - Use your institutional account to log into the Store to download, rate and review resources.</li>
			<li><strong>Contributor Login</strong> - Use a non-institutional account in the Curation app to submit new resources to the store. That way, you can share/manage that login within your organisation and not locking it down to a single organisational account.</li>
			<li><strong>Social Sharing</strong> - Sharing resources has never been easier - just click the icon on a resource page to share the link on facebook, twitter and many more.
		</ul>
		<h4>Version 1.3.2</h4>
		<p>We squashed more bugs in version 1.3.2 and included a number of useful features:</p>
		<ul class="li--releasenotes"><li><strong>Classification of resources by usage, academic level and subject</strong> - you can now add these classifications to your resources. We're working on classifying the existing resources but soon, users will be able to search by these categories in the Store.</li>
		<li><strong>Recent Downloads</strong> - Any resources you download/access from now on will conveniently appear on your profile page.</li>
		<li><strong>Resource Adoption</strong> - We've made it possible for contributors to adopt resources that were migrated over from Jorum. If you had a resource in Jorum that you want to associate with your contributor account, so that you can continue to maintain it, contact us.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The next release will include much improved 'explore' functionality and the power to search by usage, academic level and subject.</p>
   	<p>We want you to feedback on the app and resource store so if you have an idea for the Store or are having problems accessing the resources let us know on <a href="mailto:support@jiscstore.freshdesk.com">support@jiscstore.freshdesk.com</a>.
			Weâ€™ll collate these suggestions and feed them back into the development pipeline so what this becomes is really down to you!</p><br><br>
