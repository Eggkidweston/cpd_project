	<h4>Version 1.1</h4> <br />
	
	<p>The store works just like any other digital store, with a mixture of free and paid-for resources, each with clear licensing and cost. You can search and explore, and recognise good content through ratings and reviews. We are now open for submissions for free resources! Thank-you to everyone in the community that got involved!</p>
	<p>If you have a free resource you want to share with the rest of the community, you can upload it to the store platform, or simply provide a listing to it if it's an online service or resource, through the Curation app. Version 1.2 is coming soon and will start to build on the classification of resources so we can tailor the searches to suit you.</p>

   	<p>We want you to feedback on the app and resource store so if you have an idea for the Store or are having problems accessing the resources let us know. Weâ€™ll collate these suggestions and feed them back into the development pipeline so what this becomes is really down to you!</p>
