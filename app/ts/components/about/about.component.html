	<h4>Version 1.0</h4> <br />
	
	<p>The store works just like any other digital store, with a mixture of free and paid-for resources, each with clear licensing and cost. You can search and explore, and recognise good content through ratings and reviews. We’ve done what we can to uncover all that great migrated Jorum content and are reaching out and find more resources to add. Version 1.1 is coming soon and will open up new submissions to everyone.</p>

   	<p>We want you to feedback on the app and resource store so if you have an idea for the Store or are having problems accessing the resources let us know. We’ll collate these suggestions and feed them back into the development pipeline so what this becomes is really down to you!</p>
