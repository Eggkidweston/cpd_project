        <h1>Jisc App and Resource Store: Terms of Service</h1>
		<p>This page (together with the documents referred to on it) contains the terms of use by which you may use the Jisc App and Resource Store (hereafter referred to as “the App Store”) and the Resources contained therein. Please read these Terms of Service carefully before you use the App Store. By using the App Store in any way, you agree to be bound by these terms, which shall take effect immediately on your first use of the App Store. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, please refrain from using the App Store.</p>
		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<ul><li>These Terms of Service apply to the Service constituted by the App Store website, repository and API (hereafter referred to jointly as the App Store) operated by <a href="http://www.jisc.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Jisc</a> (hereafter referred to as the Service Provider). The principal contact addresses for Jisc is: One Castlepark, Tower Hill, Bristol, BS2 0JA.</li>
		<li>The App Store contains learning and teaching resources, shared on a worldwide basis under the terms of various licence arrangements, most commonly, a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/" target="_blank">Creative Commons (CC)</a> licence. When using a CC licence, the creators and owners of this content are willing and are able to share their content on this basis under the terms of a Creative Commons (CC) licence. Further details of the licence available can be found in section 7. The purpose of The App Store is to enable the sharing, reuse and repurposing of learning and teaching resources (“Resources”), doing so as a Jisc service that supports policy, practice and productivity in learning and teaching in the UK and beyond.</li>
		<li>The App Store may be accessed at different levels by Ordinary Users and Registered Users. An “Ordinary User” is any user with an internet enabled device, anywhere in the world who wishes to access The App Store. A “Registered User” is an identified individual who is either affiliated with a UK higher or further Education Institution or other institution approved by Jisc, who has provided the required personal information. (The terms ‘Users’ and ‘all Users’ refer to both Registered Users and Ordinary Users. Ordinary Users can browse, view and download content available under licence. A Registered User may: browse, view, comment on and download content under the terms of the relevant licence as well as submit content to the App Store, provided that content is licensed under a supported licence framework. On registering, a User must provide the Service Provider with some personal information. Details about how the Service Provider will use this personal information is detailed in the App Store Jisc App and Content Store Privacy Policy. Please read this before registering.</li>
		<li>The Service Provider reserves the right to disclose the identity of Registered Users to third parties who claim that material contributed infringes their rights (e.g. their privacy or IPR rights).</li>
		<li>The Service Provider reserves the right to disclose criminal activity (e.g. breach of the Computer Misuse Act 1990) to the relevant authorities.</li>
		<li>The App Store is made available free at the point of use to Registered Users and Ordinary Users and its use, including for deposit of Resources, is subject to these Terms of Service.</li>
		<li>By submitting resources to The App Store, Registered Users grant permission to the Service Provider to make these resources available through the App Store. Registered Users will licence their deposited content directly to other Users by means of an appropriate and support licence. The App Store uses an API to provide the supported licence options. Therefore when a Registered User is depositing, they are always choosing a licence from the latest options. The selected licence is referred to in these Terms as the “Relevant Licence”.</li>
		<li>The Service Provider may update these Terms of Service (including the Jisc App and Content Store Privacy Policy and the App Store: Takedown Policy) from time to time. Changes will have immediate effect from the date of posting on this website. All Users should therefore review these Terms of Service regularly. A User’s continued use of The App Store after changes have been made will be taken to indicate that they have accepted and are bound by the updated Terms of Service.</li>
		<li>Information and content available in The App Store is provided in English, which is the home language of The App Store.</li>
		<h4>Conditions of Use of the App Store</h4>

		<h4>Our and Third Party Proprietary Materials</h4>
		<li>The App Store contains proprietary materials which are owned by or licensed to the Service Provider and which are not subject to a Relevant Licence or the Creative Commons Attribution Non Commercial Licence.

		<li>Information contained in or accessible via the App Store changes on a regular basis. The Service Provider may make improvements or alterations to the App Store at any time and without notice.</li>
		<li>If any links to other websites appear in the App Store or in Resources in the App Store the Service Provider accepts no responsibility or liability for the content of that website (whether under the control of the Service Provider or otherwise). Any link is not intended to be, nor should be construed as, an endorsement of any kind by us.</li>
		<li>Should the App Store link to other websites the Service Provider will try to make it as clear as possible that the User is leaving the App Store. It is the responsibility of the User to check the terms and conditions and privacy policy on any other websites that they visit.</li>
		<h4>Liability</h4>
		<li>The Service Provider does not guarantee that:
		<ul class="alpha"><li>use of the App Store will be compatible with all hardware and software,</li>
		<li>use of the App Store will be uninterrupted or error or virus free,</li>
		<li>use of the App Store will deliver any specific outcome for its users, or</li>
		<li>defects in the App Store will be corrected. All Users must take appropriate steps to ensure that they regularly check for viruses when using the App Store or Resources downloaded from the App Store on any device.</li></ul></li>
		<li>Inclusion in the App Store of Resources submitted by Users of it or other third parties does not constitute or imply any endorsement, authorisation or recommendation by the Service Provider in relation to that material or of any opinions or other statements made within it. The Service Provider can neither monitor nor enforce compliance of third party content with all applicable laws and regulations.</li>
		<li>All Users must ensure that their use of the App Store and their Resources comply with the local laws to which they and the use of the App Store may be subject. In accordance with paragraph 33 below, the Service Provider cannot accept liability where a User breaches a local law.</li>
		<li>The Service Provider makes no statement about the suitability of the Resources, information and services contained on, or accessed via the App Store. All warranties, terms and conditions in this regard, including all warranties, terms and conditions implied by statute or otherwise, of satisfactory quality and fitness for purpose are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law. For the avoidance of doubt this includes materials accessed via links to websites (including home pages, web pages or documents they contain) operated by third parties.</li>
		<li>The Service Provider further excludes to the fullest extent permissible by law all liability for damages and direct, indirect or consequential loss (all three of which terms include pure economic loss, loss of profits, loss of business, business interruption, depletion of goodwill and like loss) or otherwise incurred by a User or any third party and arising out of or in any way connected with the use of the App Store or its Resources, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise.</li>
		<li>The User will defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Service Provider, its affiliates and its officers, directors, employees and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses or expenses, including reasonable legal costs, arising out of or in any way connected with any breach by that User of these Terms (including the Relevant Licences).</li>

		<li>These terms (including the Relevant Licences), the Jisc App and Content Store Privacy Policy and the App Store: Takedown Policy contain all the terms applicable to use of the App Store by any User.
